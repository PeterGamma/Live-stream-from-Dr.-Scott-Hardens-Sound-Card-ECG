   Live stream is also possible from Sound Card ECG with AD8232 from Scott Harden. Sound cards have 16 bit sampling rate, which is higher than the 8 - 10 bit sampling rate of the standard Bitalino ECG.
  
  This device was developed by the experienced neuroscientist and low-cost biomedical device builder Scott Harden, which is a social animal, and does make it easy to get real time data, as compared to Garmin devices. More than 10 years of experience makes Scott an excellent device builder, who bild an excellent high quality low cost device which is potentially a research grade device.
