   Live stream is also possible from Sound Card ECG with AD8232 from Scott Harden. Sound cards have 16 bit sampling rate, which is higher than the 8 - 10 bit sampling rate of the standard Bitalino ECG.
  
  This device was developed by the experienced research scientist and low-cost biomedical device builder Scott Harden, which is a social animal, and does make it easy to get real time data, as compared to Garmin devices. More than 10 years of experience makes Scott an excellent device builder, who built a high quality low cost device which is potentially a research grade device.

  Signal transmission over an audio cable to a soundcard is more stable than over bluetooth 3.0. With wireless transmission, it is always a risk that the connection is lost.
  
  Scott has developed high quality open source data aquisition software for his sound Card ECG, which is easy to use, and could potentially be integrated in other data aquisition software and platforms (MIT licence).
