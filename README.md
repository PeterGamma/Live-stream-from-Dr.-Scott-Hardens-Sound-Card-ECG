   Live stream is also possible from Sound Card ECG with AD8232 from Dr. Scott Harden. Sound cards have 16 bit sampling rate, which is higher than the 8 - 10 bit sampling rate of the standard Bitalino ECG.
  
  This device was developed by the experienced neuroscientist and low-cost biomedical device builder Scott Harden, which is a social animal, and does make it easy to get real time data, as compared to Garmin devices. More than 10 years of developement which is still alive makes this device an excellent high quality low cost research grade device.
